tech258-Joe-learn-s3-vm

SSH into instance
```

2. Once you have set that up make sure to ssh into your instance in gitbash. 

3. What do we do always when we ssh into our instance? **UPDATE AND UPGRADE**

```
sudo apt update -y

sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -y
```

3. Now we need to install python 3 and AWS. Add the following commands üëç

```
# check if pyhton 3 is already installed
python3 --version 

sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

#install aws cli
sudo pip install awscli 

# version check
aws --version 
```

4. Next you need to rename python  - use the ALias command
   
   ```
   alias python=python3 
   ```
   
   

5. 
   Add the follwing command to authenticate with specific ID and secret access ID!
   (your secret key folder should be in your ssh folder)

```
aws configure
< access key> : <your key goes here>
< secret key> : <your key goes here>
# region name: eu-west-1
# output: json
```


Now you are in and verified!
