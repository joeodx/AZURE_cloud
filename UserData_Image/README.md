# Automating in with user data

We can actually automate the whole process of creating our application and database by posting our whole script in the user data section in advanced tab.

Yo ucan paste your entire script into your user data section in the advanced tab when you are makign your VM

* Then click review and create

To check your database is running you will have to SSH into your vm using gitbash and check its status 

REMEMBER it will take the same time to deploy so wait 3-5 minutes like if you did it manually. 

You can check your applciation is running by SSH into it on gitbash or jsut put the public ip address in the URL.
