## Load testing with the package Apache 

* If you want to test how many requets your application can get, you need to do load test. 
* The main objective of a load test is to determine the system's behavior concerning its response time, throughput, and resource utilization when subjected to various levels of simulated user activity or workload.

1. First of all SSH into your app instance on gitbash
  
2.  Then type the following command to install Apache

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

3.  Once you have done that you can load test your website wit hthe following commmand üëç
  ```
  ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://20.90.163.1
  ```

  ***The n value = the total requets and the c value = how many request you are making at one time.***

4. You can change this value to your liking.

5. Then have a look at your CPU used chart on your dashboard and seee the results!
